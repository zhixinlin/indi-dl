        <p>Dear <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>,</p>

        <p>Thank you for purchasing your copy of the Elemental Paradigm!</p>

        <p>We have worked incredibly hard to create an audio course that’s as comprehensive and informative as this, and we do hope that you enjoy it!</p>

        <p>But before you begin, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, please go through this short instructional that will tell you exactly where to begin, and what to expect.</p>

        <p>Now, here’s what I want you to do, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="purple">Step 1:</span> Please bookmark this link in case you lose the e-mail that was sent to you earlier. You could also write down the URL of this page on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere safe! Are you finished, Friend? Perfect!</p>

        <p><span class="purple">Step 2:</span> Scroll down and click on the “Download Now” button directly below to save all of the materials into your computer in the form of a compressed zip file. This will store the entire series into your computer (if you’re accessing this from a mobile device, you can simply tap on the “Download Now” button instead). Alternatively, you can scroll down even further to download the individual materials by right-clicking on the respective “Download Now” buttons and selecting “Save Link As”.</p>

        <p>Now, without any further delay, let’s get started! <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, are you ready?</p>
